DEEPFAKE DETECTION
This project is a deep learning-based deepfake detection system that identifies AI-generated manipulations in videos or images. The model outputs a **confidence score** indicating the probability that the media is real or fake, enabling transparent decision-making.

ðŸ§  **Features**:
- Deepfake classification using a trained neural network
- Confidence score output (0â€“100%)
- Intuitive web dashboard for media upload and analysis
- Real-time detection results with frame-level analysis
